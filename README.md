Code repository git url :
https://github.com/sv969/CS-567-FinalProject
Overview:
The Pet Adoption System’s code has been reviewed to evaluate its structure, functionality, and compliance with best practices. The system consists of several classes for handling pet management, volunteer coordination, events, and inquiries within an adoption center. Below is a detailed report highlighting its strengths. The code does exist on GitHub and was written purely for testing purposes. The testing technologies used include TSTL, unit tests, coverage, and universal mutator. These technologies come together to from a complete and cohesive test suite that can give valuable insights into the validity, correctness and reliability of the code.
Strengths:
Modular Design:
•	The code is organized into separate classes, each responsible for a specific aspect of the adoption center management.
•	The design encourages code reusability, scalability, and maintainability.
Clear Class Responsibilities:
•	Each class has well-defined characteristics and methods that represent distinct functionalities.
•	This improves code readability, making it easier to comprehend and maintain.
Error Handling:
•	Some methods use error handling tools to deal with potential exceptions.
•	This reduces runtime errors and increases system robustness.



Testing Process: 
Here, we have to follow the Testing processes for applications and get the reports. The testing process is a critical phase in software development, ensuring product quality and reliability. It involves various stages such as planning, designing test cases, execution, and reporting. Testers employ techniques like functional testing, regression testing, and user acceptance testing to uncover defects and ensure the software meets requirements. Automation tools streamline repetitive tasks, enhancing efficiency. Continuous integration and delivery practices integrate testing into development workflows, enabling rapid feedback and iteration. Ultimately, a robust testing process enhances user satisfaction, reduces maintenance costs, and fosters trust in the software's performance.

Code coverage:  Code coverage measures the proportion of code executed during testing compared to the total codebase. It helps assess the thoroughness of testing, identifying areas not exercised by test cases. High coverage indicates more comprehensive testing, reducing the likelihood of undiscovered bugs and improving overall software quality. Below screenshot is refers to the code coverage percentage for given problem.
 

Unit tests: Unit testing is a practice in software development where individual units or components of a software application are tested in isolation. It verifies that each unit functions correctly as per design specifications. Automated tools execute these tests, ensuring rapid feedback and early detection of defects, aiding in maintaining code quality. Below screenshot is refers to the code coverage percentage for given problem.
 

TSTL testing: TSTL (Test Scripting Language) is a domain-specific language designed for automated testing. It enables concise and expressive test case specification, simplifying the creation and maintenance of test suites. With its rich feature set, TSTL facilitates effective testing of complex systems, enhancing efficiency and test coverage. Below screenshot is refers to the code coverage percentage for given problem.
 

Mutation testing: Mutation testing is a method in software testing where small changes, or mutations, are made to the source code. The goal is to assess the quality of the test cases by checking if they can detect and reject these mutations, indicating robustness. Below screenshot is refers to the code coverage percentage for given problem.
 

Conclusion:
Overall, the Pet Adoption System's code has a strong foundation because of its modular design, explicit class roles, and error handling features. The organized structure encourages code reuse, scalability, and maintainability, allowing for future upgrades or alterations. Furthermore, the thorough testing procedure, which includes code coverage analysis, unit tests, TSTL testing, and mutation testing, ensures the system's dependability and resilience.
